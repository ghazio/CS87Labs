Some example bash script for running experiments

  * run.sh:  example bash script for running a bunch of experiments
             with different input parameters.  To run:

             ./run.sh

  * run_outfile.sh:  example bash script for running a bunch of 
                     experiments with different parameters and
                     capturing all output to a file.  To run:

                     ./run_outfile.sh  myoutputfile

 * killmytests.sh: an example script that to kill all your experiments: 
 
   (1) first pkill -9 the run script (run_outfile.sh in this example) 
   (2) then pkill -9  your program executable (matrixmult in this example)

    This script is very useful if you want to stop your experiments 
    from running in the middle of the night when you are asleep.
    You can also start your experiments running in the middle of the
    night when you are alseep.  To do this you want to use cron, which
    is a job scheduler that uses a time to run a particular job.
    
 You can add a cron job to run your script at a particular date and
 time by editing the crontab file on the machine you are running your
 experiments (ex. on chervil):

  $ ssh chervil

  $ crontab -e

  Then add a line like this to run the killmytests.sh script at 
  a specific time and date (at 8pm (20:00), on January (1) 31 : 
                   
  0 20 31 1 * /home/newhall/public/cs87/experiment_tools/killmytests.sh  

  Similarly you can add a cron job to run your experiements at a specific
  time (here I'm starting them at 4:05 am on February 3):

  5 4 3 2 * /home/newhall/public/cs87/experiment_tools/run_outfile.sh ./mytests
