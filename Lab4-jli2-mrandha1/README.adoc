=  Lab 4 starting point

* `Makefile`: builds oddevensort and questions.pdf  

* `oddevensort.c`:  starting point for your solution

* `hostfile, hostfilebig`, ...: some exaple hostfiles you can use for running

* `check_up.sh`: script to check if hosts in a hostfile are reachable
  (remove any that are not).  To run: `./check_up.sh hostfilename`

* `run.sh`: an example run script to test different sizes (you will likely want to 
          write your own; this is just one example.  To run: `./run.sh`
+
`runbigger.sh` is another example with some sizes that are a little larger
than run.sh (which are all very small).  The size values here are still
not that huge, but the number of process is much bigger.

* `questions.tex`: latex starting point file into which to add your
  complexity answers.  Make builds questions.pdf from this.

* `RESULTS`:
  file into which you should copy your (edited) results from different
  size runs on our system.  You may be able to scale to runs on about 
  128 hosts on our system.  However, see my notes about the check_up.sh 
  and autoMPIgen on the assignment page. And see my notes about being
  mindful of not overloading CS lab machines during class, lab, ninja
  sessions.
